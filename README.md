# Chinese Poetry Generation

This is our course project for CSCI 544 (Spring 2017) at USC.

We have implemented two Chinese poem generators using two different methods.

## Rule-based Poem Generator

[rule\_based/](rule_based/) is a poem generator based on a trained word model and predefined format constraints.

## RNN-based Poem Generator

[rnn\_based/](rnn_based/) is a poem generator based on the RNN encoder-decoder framework.
